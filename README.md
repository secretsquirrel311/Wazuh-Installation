So I guess any good cyberpro loves their opensource tools - espescially for a broke entry level pro like me. For this project, I am going to be spinning up Wazuh SIEM to start learning how to perform cybersecurity analysis on aggregated logs. Essentially, I am wanting to focus on finding IoC's, vulnerability identification and management, advanced configuration of Wazuh for an enterprise environment and whatever seems like fun to me.
I am debating on whether after I finish the base setup and learning objectives, if I want to dabble in automating the whole process using Ansible next.. Time will tell.
