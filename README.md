I guess any good cyberpro loves their opensource tools - espescially for a broke entry level pro like me. For this project, I am going to be spinning up the Wazuh SIEM (Indexer, Server, and Agents) to start learning how to perform cybersecurity analysis on aggregated logs. Essentially, I am wanting to focus on finding IoC's, vulnerability identification and management, advanced configuration of Wazuh for an enterprise environment and whatever seems like fun to me. Additionally, I will be creating a write up for each proof of concept objective and how it applies to the MITRE att&ck framework.

Proof of Concepts objectives I'll be working through:
1. Blocking a known malicious actor
2. File integrity monitoring
3. Detecting a brute-force attack
4. Monitoring Docker events
5. Monitoring AWS infrastructure
6. Detecting unauthorized processes
7. Network IDS integration
8. Detecting a SQL injection attack
9. Detecting suspicious binaries
10. Detect / Remove malware using VirusTotal integration
11. Vulnerability detection
12. Detecting malware using YARA integration
13. Detecting hidden processes
14. Monitoring execution of malicious commands
15. Detecting a Shellshock attack
16. Leveraging LLMs for alert enrichment

I am debating on whether after I finish the base setup and learning objectives, if I want to dabble in automating the whole process using Ansible next.. Time will tell.
